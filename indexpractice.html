    <h1>Patti Perry</h1>
    <p>For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

        A little happy sunlight shining through there. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. What the devil. You can get away with a lot. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.
        
        Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We need dark in order to show light.
        
        We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
        
        La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.
        
        I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You have to make these big decisions. I like to beat the brush. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone.
        
        If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. There are no limits in this world. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>
